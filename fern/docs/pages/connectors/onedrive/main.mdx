## Overview

The Onedrive connector allows you to sync data from Onedrive into Airweave, making it available for search and retrieval by your agents.

## Configuration


### OneDriveSource

OneDrive source implementation (read-only).

#### Authentication

This connector uses **OAuth 2.0 with refresh token**.

This connector uses OAuth authentication. You can connect through the Airweave UI, which will guide you through the OAuth flow.


## Entities

The following data models are available for this connector:


<details>
<summary><strong>OneDriveDriveEntity</strong></summary>

Schema for a OneDrive Drive object.

The inherited entity_id stores the drive's unique ID. Additional key fields come
from the OneDrive/SharePoint drive resource. Owner and quota are typically
nested objects; we store them as dictionaries.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| drive_type | Optional[str] | Describes the type of drive represented by this resource (e.g., personal or business). |
| owner | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | Information about the user or application that owns this drive. |
| quota | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | Information about the drive's storage quota (total, used, remaining, etc.). |
| created_at | Optional[datetime] | Datetime when the drive was created (from createdDateTime). |
| updated_at | Optional[datetime] | Datetime when the drive was last modified (from lastModifiedDateTime). |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>OneDriveDriveItemEntity</strong></summary>

Schema for a OneDrive DriveItem object (file or folder).

The inherited entity_id stores the DriveItem's unique ID. Many fields are optional
because a DriveItem may represent either a file or a folder, and some properties
appear only in one context.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| name | Optional[str] | The name of the item (folder or file). |
| etag | Optional[str] | An eTag for the content of the item. Used for change tracking. |
| ctag | Optional[str] | A cTag for the content of the item. Used for internal sync. |
| created_at | Optional[datetime] | Datetime when the item was created (from createdDateTime). |
| updated_at | Optional[datetime] | Datetime when the item was last modified (from lastModifiedDateTime). |
| size | Optional[int] | Size of the item in bytes. |
| web_url | Optional[str] | URL that displays the resource in the browser. |
| file | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | File metadata if the item is a file (e.g., mimeType, hashes). |
| folder | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | Folder metadata if the item is a folder (e.g., childCount). |
| parent_reference | Optional[Dict[str, Any]] | Information about the parent of this item, such as driveId or parent folder path. |

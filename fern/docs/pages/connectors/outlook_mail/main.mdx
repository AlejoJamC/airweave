## Overview

The Outlook Mail connector allows you to sync data from Outlook Mail into Airweave, making it available for search and retrieval by your agents.

## Configuration


### OutlookMailSource

Outlook Mail source implementation (read-only).

This connector retrieves Outlook mail folders in a hierarchical fashion
and yields OutlookMailFolderEntity for each folder. For each folder, it
also retrieves email messages and yields OutlookMessageEntity items.

#### Authentication

This connector uses **OAuth 2.0 with refresh token**.

You can connect through the Airweave UI, which will guide you through the OAuth flow.

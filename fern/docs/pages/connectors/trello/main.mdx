## Overview

## Configuration


### TrelloSource

Trello source implementation.

    This connector retrieves data from Trello objects such as Organizations,
    Boards, Lists, Cards, Members, and Actions, then yields them as entities using
    their respective Trello entity schemas. This version also utilizes the
    'breadcrumb' pattern to reflect the hierarchy:
      Organization → Board → List → Card

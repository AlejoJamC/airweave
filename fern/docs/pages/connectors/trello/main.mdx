## Overview

The Trello connector allows you to sync data from Trello into Airweave, making it available for search and retrieval by your agents.

## Configuration


### TrelloSource

Trello source implementation.

    This connector retrieves data from Trello objects such as Organizations,
    Boards, Lists, Cards, Members, and Actions, then yields them as entities using
    their respective Trello entity schemas. This version also utilizes the

      Organization → Board → List → Card

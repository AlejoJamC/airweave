Airweave is an open-source platform that connects to your apps, databases, documents, and productivity tools, transforming them into searchable knowledge bases. These knowledge bases are accessible through our SDKs, REST APIs and MCP servers. Airweave is built for developers who want their AI agents to access and search across multiple data sources seamlessly.

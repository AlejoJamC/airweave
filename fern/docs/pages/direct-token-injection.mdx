subtitle: Create source connections or trigger syncs by supplying OAuth&nbsp;2.0 tokens directly.
slug: direct-token-injection

### Use case

If you embed Airweave inside your own product you might already manage OAuth 2.0 tokens for your users.
In that case, you do not want to have to ask them to click through a second consent screen for Airweave.
Airweave therefore allows you to provide existing tokens to Airweave directly, so that

  - Your service owns token storage and rotation.
  - Airweave consumes the tokens solely for data sync.
  - No additional user interaction required.

There are two common scenarios:

1. **Trigger a sync** on an existing source connection with a one-off access token.
2. **Create a new source connection** by sending both the access token and, if available, the refresh token.

The next sections walk you through both flows.

### Trigger a sync with a temporary token

By default, Airweave uses the credentials obtained during the initial OAuth 2.0 handshake to run a data synchronization job.
If you pass an `access_token` in the request body, Airweave temporarily overrides the stored credentials for this run and uses your provided token instead.

> **Note**: Airweave will *not* attempt to refresh the provided token. If the token expires before the sync finishes the job will fail.

Here is an example:


<CodeBlocks>
```Python title="Python"
from airweave import AirweaveSDK

airweave = AirweaveSDK(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", base_url="https://api.airweave.ai")

collection = airweave.source_connections.run(name="My First Collection")
```

```javascript title="Node.js"
import { AirweaveSDKClient } from "@airweave/sdk";

const airweave = new AirweaveSDKClient({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", base_url="https://api.airweave.ai"});
```

```bash title="cURL"
curl -X POST https://api.airweave.ai/source-connections/source_connection_id/run \
     -H "x-api-key: <apiKey>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
        "access_token": "ya29.a0AWY7CkkH3CqZXRQ3ZQZHy3lFf6zM7G_9Z5FgkUOzAeoKZs8opR7KXpK5RvXWkGq2vFQmE"
     }'
```
</CodeBlocks>


### Create a source connection with your own tokens

Skip the OAuth 2.0 flow entirely by sending your own tokens in the `POST /source-connections` call. You are responsible for acquiring and storing these tokens—Airweave simply uses what you provide.

> **Note on token refresh**: If you include a `refresh_token`, Airweave *will* refresh the access token as needed. This can invalidate the copy you store, so be prepared to handle token updates.

If you are using this because you prefer to keep Airweave invisible to your users and show your own branding on the consent screen, check out our [white labeling feature](https://docs.airweave.ai/white-label).

Creating a source connection with direct tokens looks like this:

<CodeBlocks>
```Python title="Python"
from airweave import AirweaveSDK

airweave = AirweaveSDK(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", base_url="https://api.airweave.ai")

collection = airweave.collections.create_collection(name="My First Collection")
```

```javascript title="Node.js"
import { AirweaveSDKClient } from "@airweave/sdk";

const airweave = new AirweaveSDKClient({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", base_url="https://api.airweave.ai"});

const collection = await airweave.collections.createCollection({name: "My First Collection"});
```

```bash title="cURL"
curl -X POST https://api.airweave.ai/source-connections \
     -H "x-api-key: <apiKey>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "name": "Asana connection",
  "short_name": "asana",
  "auth_fields": {
    "access_token": "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN",
    "refresh_token": "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
  },
  "sync_immediately": true
}'
```
</CodeBlocks>

### Upcoming feature: Pipedream & Composio integrations

We are currently building a way for users to connect to a source via **Pipedream** and **Composio**, with Airweave integrating with these platforms directly.

If you have an edge case that isn’t covered by these features, please let us know at **hello@airweave.ai**.

## What is Airweave?

Airweave is an open-source tool that makes **any app searchable** for your agent by syncing your users' app data, APIs, databases and websites into your vector database with minimal configuration.

## Architecture Overview

Airweave consists of several key components that work together:

### Sources
Sources are the data providers that Airweave can sync from. These include:
- APIs
- Databases
- File systems
- SaaS applications
- Websites

### Chunk Generators
Each source defines an async `generate_chunks()` function that yields data in a consistent format. This allows Airweave to:
- Break down data into processable pieces
- Maintain consistency across different data sources
- Enable custom chunk generation for specific needs

### Vector Database Integration
Airweave supports multiple vector databases including:
- Chroma
- Milvus
- Pinecone
- Qdrant
- Weaviate

### Sync Management
Data synchronization is handled through:
- Scheduled syncs
- On-demand sync jobs
- Version control and hashing for change detection
- Async processing for large-scale operations

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Airweave provides white-labeled multi-tenant support:
- OAuth2-based platform for secure data syncing
- Privacy and security maintained across tenants
- Ideal for SaaS builders and enterprise applications

## Data Flow

1. **Source Connection**: Connect to data sources via OAuth or API keys
2. **Chunk Generation**: Data is processed into manageable chunks
3. **Vector Storage**: Chunks are embedded and stored in your vector database
4. **Retrieval**: Access data via your agent or search mechanism

## Key Features

### No-Code First
- GUI-based configuration
- Simple click-through setup
- Extensible for custom needs

### Automated Sync
- Schedule-based synchronization
- On-demand sync capabilities
- Change detection via versioning

### Scalability
- Local development with Docker Compose
- Production deployment options
- Async-first architecture


## Security & Privacy

Airweave maintains security through:
- OAuth2 authentication
- Secure token management
- Data isolation between tenants
- Version control and audit trails
